# Agent Instructions

**Before coding:** Read [docs/PROJECT_MASTER.md](../docs/PROJECT_MASTER.md) (engineering) and [docs/PRODUCT_STRATEGY_AND_ROADMAP.md](../docs/PRODUCT_STRATEGY_AND_ROADMAP.md) (what to build next, RBAC, market position).

**State management:** Use **Redux Toolkit** behind feature hooks (`useSidebar`, `useChat`, etc.). Components must never import `store/` or use `useSelector`/`useDispatch` directly.

**Module layout:** Each feature under `src/<name>/` uses atomic folders: `atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`, `screens/`, `hooks/`, `state/` (+ `services/` when needed). Screens compose module + `common` UI/hooks only. Shared cross-feature code lives in `src/common/` (including `lib/`, `config/`, `store/`). See `src/README.md`.

**Naming:** PascalCase for React component files (including screens); camelCase for hooks (`use*`) and Redux slices (`*Slice`); kebab-case for module/route folders and shadcn `ui/` files; `*.service.ts` / `*.config.ts` for typed non-UI modules.
